# 🧱 Triangle on Rectangle – OpenGL Computer Graphics Project

This is a modern C++ OpenGL project using the **GLFW** library to draw a simple 2D triangle placed on top of a rectangle. Developed for my Computer Graphics Lab at UITS, it demonstrates basic shape rendering using OpenGL with a GLFW window context.

## 🎯 Objective

To understand and implement basic rendering of 2D shapes using modern OpenGL with GLFW. The program opens a window and displays a rectangle as a base with a triangle placed on top—similar to a house-like structure.
